    "Imagine you are an expert at controlling a bipedal machine, and you have been given the task of controlling a bipedal machine in a reinforcement learning environment. The challenge is to walk a bipedal machine as far as possible without falling over. The machine has a hull, two legs, a back and front revolute joint, and lower leg. The machine has 10 lidar sensors that can detect the distance to objects in front of it. \n",
